# Code Formatter
This program has the use that the user can click a button indicating what language given code is in, and then the program will convert that code to whatever format is specified by the user, based on templates. For instance, if the code is Java or C (Or pretty much most non-assembly coding), it wonâ€™t matter if the code looks messy, is inconsistent, etc. The result will be code that looks neat, has even spacing, etc.

User options will be what kind of spacing and things like that, such as if they want to use tabs or spaces, when they want to separate by new lines (Aside from lines of code, of course), and things like that.
